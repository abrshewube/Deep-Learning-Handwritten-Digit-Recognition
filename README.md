## About MNIST dataset:
MNIST [(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database)](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyann.lecun.com%2Fexdb%2Fmnist%2F) is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale training images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes.
